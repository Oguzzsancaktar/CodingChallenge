# AI Usage Statement

This project was built with assistance from an AI pair-programmer to speed up scaffolding and boilerplate under a tight deadline. The AI was used for:

- Selecting a fast, standard stack (Express + TS, Vite React + TS) and npm workspaces
- Generating initial project structure, configuration, and safe defaults (security middleware, logging, env validation)
- Writing straightforward glue code (health route, client API helper, proxy config)
- Drafting documentation (README, this AI_USAGE file)

Human decisions included:
- Choosing libraries and enforcing clean architecture boundaries
- Reviewing and editing generated code for clarity, type-safety, and best practices
- Ensuring minimal, senior-level defaults (Zod env validation, rate limiting, CORS, Helmet, Pino)

Why AI: accelerates repetitive setup to focus the remaining time on business logic (auth/profile, GitHub API integration) and code quality.
